# HHMDA
    This work develops a based on Heterogeneous hypergraph convolution and multi-order convolution of heterogeneous graph model, namely HHMDA to perform a MiRNA-Disease Association prediction task. 
    
# Example
    To run HHMDAon your data, execute the following command from the project home directory:
	'python main.py'.
	
# Dependencies
    HHMDAwas implemented with python 3.7.15. To run HHMDA was you need these packages:    
    tensorflow(1.14.0)
    numpy (1.21.6)
    Keras(2.2.5)
    scipy(1.7.3)
    scikit-learn (1.0.2)

# Input 
    the input files include:
    miRNA-disease associations data, disease semantic similarity data, miRNA sequence similarity data, disease-gene associations data and miRNA-gene associations data.

# output
    Evaluation metrics based on HHMDA test data.
